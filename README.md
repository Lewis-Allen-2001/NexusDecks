# NexusDecks

This is just a little side project i'm working on whilst i'm doing the tech educators software dev course. It's a trading card game website that caters towards magic the gathering , Yu-Gi-Oh and Pokemon. It covers all news across the three games and includes thier own respective websites and deck builders. I stole some of my code from my week 1 project and implemented it into this website , added and improved upon more things.

Further down the line I want to add a database that features all cards across the three games and add the prices of the individual cards. I would also like to build my own custom deck builder.
